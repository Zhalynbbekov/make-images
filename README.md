# make-images
What is it?
How does it works?
------------
This is a code that take your photo and conver it to b&w color and resize it to 1080X1080 instagram size, filter the image, and put the watermark to it.

Documentation
-------------
We used os module and PIL libraries. And we used "Wall Notes.otf" font. To use this font you have to first install it from internet.
If you don't have Pillow library install it by using below comand:
pip install pillow 

How can we use it?
--------------
We have to show path to your folder and add images to your folder. Our image should be '.jpg' or '.png' extention. After adding just run it.
